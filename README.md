# ctf-rs-core

> Core lib crate for `ctf-rs`

I decided to make this for two reasons

1. CTFd has some enterprise/managed gated features I though should be opened up (programmable flags)
2. I wanted a cloud native CTF platform. (ie `kubernetes-api` + `helm-charts`)

This library is intended to be used as a base for CTF-rs to provide a common API for all CTF-rs plugins.
